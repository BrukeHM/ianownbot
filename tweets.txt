yo branch's twitter game has been on point lately
where the haters at
@haley :(((((
@jmohsenin also we don't have any sort of real time contract implied in the product like with twitter or facebook.
@jmohsenin ummmm would probably run into issues at high scale but it's not really a priority rn
@jmohsenin rails. it's what we know and can iterate fastest on. otherwise would consider nodejs
maybe bc ruby is already ooc unless you pay a lot of attention?
i don't mean that in a mean way i mean they are all just real scurred of like needing to worry about anything new (concurrency)
ruby programmers are kind of sissies

maybe i should get a cat
@slyphon ok i'll do that first
@slyphon yeah. idk i guess i'll pay my power bill and get them out here
@slyphon no that one is fine. the main one at the right for half my shit. separate from the tiny one that won't go back on
@slyphon ok but this is likely why the main breaker keeps tripping? i am leaving it off and can't figure out what it goes to?
one of the switches on my power switch thing won't go back to "on" after i switched it "off" what does that mean
@fat i would be so stoked if he made a crew out of the people who ft on 1train

ghost cats
i think the dream was related to my stomping neighbor

and it was just more annoying than anything because they would like try to make creepy noises but i was like this isnt as scary as the mvies
i just had the craziest dream about my house being haunted. basically it was haunted by a bunch of cats and the worst ghosts ever

@sippey i am sorry i got mad i &lt;3 you and i &lt;3 twitter. you won me back over with that last rt
@sippey just give me an @iano only feature that tells me "from mobile" or "from the world wide web" or "from a blackberry?!?!"
@sippey i know you know
@sippey why do i need to make assumptions what kind of product is this
@sippey i do this already and it makes me anxious because i cant know what type of device they tweeted it from!!!
@sippey god finally. don't you have some say in this?
@mccv yeah definitely.

look in the mirror and read my tweets aloud
@hotdogfever69 #twitterafterdark
@hotdogfever69 idk i think my tweets are just #latenighttweets and so 9pm west coast time isn't cutting it
2002 sounds like a year from the future but it is not
literally new york imports their internet connections from 2002
@teenslut666 i gotta like time shift my tweets or something
@danielwilber holy fuck this fucked my whole life up
@teenslut666 i'm fucked.
@teenslut666 11 west coast was mine but 11 east coast is fucking my whole shit up

@goldman do you see how fast i @replied that i have a problem :/
@goldman yes you understand me
i get really anxious when i tweet too much
@teenslut666 if you tweeted this without the @reply i bet you would get at least 5 favs 1 retweet
what sentence isn't better when you all caps it
@cra ill buy 50 for your welcoming party when you and @fat move
rewinding netflix 5 minutes because you were tweeting is the modern rereading paragraphs because you spaced out
@cra @sippey i am upset.
@sippey it has been like 5 months since we dm'd about this i thought we were bros
@teenslut666 alright ill trust you but i'm unfollowing if you're wrong
@teenslut666 idk i'm not as down with aliens
@twitter someone ask a tea time question about the app link under a tweet and skype me in this is fucked
@teenslut666 season 2!
twitter needs to bring back the app link under a tweet @sippey what the fuck how can i creep like this
@goldman what have i been saying
avoiding everyone as a service
@teenslut666 megu gets a house furby gets to watch you watch tv. sus

i don't think you guys fully appreciate my lifestyle
you know i just watched the entire first season of american horror story in the last 3 days

@teenslut666 no because i don't have an instagram
i would pay a billion dollars if nasa took a cat to the moon

95% chance you are a sociopath if you say "i love the rain"
follows for my haters
@dhg haters unfollow
@yeahimfreaky suicide pacts for my haters
what if jay z ran for mayor of new york
*enters a deep depression due to weather*

@fat nah my therapist needed an hour at least
@teenslut666 right?! facetime will be our first lesson. mail me a polaroid or something
@teenslut666 imagine being in love with someone on the internet for years and not getting nudes once?!
@teenslut666 half the show will us teaching people how to use the internet
rt if you want me and @teenslut666 to help you meet your internet love
@teenslut666 i'm trying to help other people find their love!
@teenslut666 this show is awesome!!! imagine if we could get a twitter crew together to host it
@mccv look who's got vague metaphors now
@olix0r idk why i keep favin your corny jokes
i'm worried i have alienated my followers
@mccv yes! please!
down to kick it not down to fav
if i could just kick it with a dude in a gimp suit on the couch and he laughed at my jokes i would be pretty down
basically this show is a soap opera with creepy music and a demon in a gimp suit
rt if you are trying to get with everyone you ever favd
@artnotfound yeah like a next level awkward way of flirting
"weird twitter innovator" will go on my gravestone
is subfavin a thing? did i just coin that?
god i give up i can't spell twitter sucks
watching american horror story until i die rip
@terminalcrush you say "oh ian" to me all the time!!
